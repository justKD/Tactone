# Tactone
 
### [This is an old, archived project. It was once available on the iOS app store, but it has not been recently maintained or updated.]

Tactone is metronome app. It was designed to remove a lot of the UI clutter found in other metronome apps. It also synthesized its sound creating a more dynamic click via physical modeling rather than using prerecorded sound files.

The appstore pics are below, and the appstore video can be found in the media folder.
